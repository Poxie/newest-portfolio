I have always had great interest in web development despite my studies of natural science. Therefore, a lot of my time outside of school is spent programming. Further down the site, some of my projects can be found.

My journey began after a while of being persuaded. At first things were not looking nice, but I quickly picked up the main ideas of the languages of web development. As we move along the timeline React comes into the picture. It revolutionized the way I wrote code and I fell in love immediately. Since the rise of React I have picked up different design tools and different technologies for backend development; enough to call myself a full-stack developer.", "id": "my-story", "tiles": ["First day in 2017", "Quickly picked up frontend", "Grew to love React", "Began my backend journey", "Discovered design tools"] }
