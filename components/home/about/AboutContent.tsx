I have always had great interest in web development despite my studies of natural science. Therefore, a lot of my time outside of school is spent programming. Further down the site, some of my projects can be found. If you don\'t find me programming it is likely you can find me playing games with friends or cuddling with my cats!', id: 'who-am-i', extra: <></> },

My journey began after a while of being persuaded. At first things were not looking nice, but I quickly picked up the main ideas of the languages of web development. As we move along the timeline React comes into the picture. It revolutionized the way I wrote code and I fell in love immediately. Since the rise of React I have picked up different design tools and different technologies for backend development; enough to call myself a full-stack developer.', id: 'my-story', extra: <></> }
